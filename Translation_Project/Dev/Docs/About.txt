A complete English translation for the Ragnarok Online kRO Client!
===============================================================

This is a translation pack for the Korean Ragnarok Online game client that includes
everything you need to fully translate the entire game client into English.

The item and skill descriptions are based on iRO translations and have had many
corrections and additions suggested by members of the Ragnarok fan community, as well
as the work done by the authors of the two individual translation packs. So far the item
names and descriptions as well as the patch client and in-game buttons/dialogs have
been compiled by Me, with the skill names and descriptions having been compiled by midas.

Both of these projects have been merged into an SVN repository generously supplied by
iKKe, which allows other members of the community to help Poki#3 and midas in the huge
task of keeping it all up to date.

Please note that there are NO custom items in this translation pack!

Installing the translation pack
--------------------------------
The easiest way to install the translation pack is using the RAR releases, these are split
into three sections to make updates easier and downloads smaller. Installing them is as
simple as extracting the RAR file to your Ragnarok Online directory using WinRAR or 7-Zip.

Each pack has a v?? at the beginning which is the version number of that pack, the
version number will only increase when something in that section needs updating.
The version number of the BMPs and Texture packs will always be much lower that the Text
pack as the Text section is updated very frequently, the BMPs and Texture folder do not
change very often and so they require fewer releases.

Always make sure you have the latest version of each pack to stay up to date, the Patcher pack is optional,
if you are not sure which you need then install all (having backed up your old data folder/clients!).


Tips for people having problems
----------------------------------
If this is the first time you are using the translation pack then it is recommended you
rename your old data folder and rebuild it using the these translation packs so no old
files are left behind to cause problems. You can then copy in any custom items or bits you
need that are not part of the translation packs from your old data folder.

If you hex your own sakexe using the diff patcher then make sure you select
"[Data](7) Use Plain Text Descriptions" when making your exe or your item descriptions will
appear as gibberish in the game! If you can't change your sakexe for whatever reason and
these descriptions still show up as gibberish then grab a copy of ragtxtpr from
http://eamirror.skamfroj.net. Use ragtxtpr to encode num2itemdesctable.txt and
idnum2itemdesctable.txt and it should fix the problem.

If any of the following files exist in your data folder, and you don't use any custom
items, then it is recommended you remove them...
bookitemnametable.txt, carditemnametable.txt, fogparametertable.txt,
indoorrswtable.txt, itemparamtable.txt, itemslotcounttable.txt, itemslottable.txt,
leveluseskillspamount.txt, mapobjlighttable.txt, metalprocessitemtable.txt,
mp3nametable.txt, num2cardillustnametable.txt, resnametable.txt

These files do not need translating and are best read directly from the sdata.grf, as long
as you keep kRO Sakray updated you will be 100% sure that you wont get any error's
due to old files. If you want these files for custom items then extract them yourself,
we will not provide them!

They are hexed to display the english messages contained in the IRO patcher, instead of the original korean messages.

!WARNING! The kRO *resnametables are NOT recommended unless you use custom items and you KNOW what the resnametables do.
That's why they are not provided anymore, you must extract them from your sdata.grf yourself.
