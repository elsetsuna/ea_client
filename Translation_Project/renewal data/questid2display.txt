Mr. Kidd's request was simpler than you thought. At Southwest Morroc, you must meet Rin at the underground tavern.#

Echinacea is analyzing the pattern number to detect the magic wavelength strength. This could lead us to Rayan and maybe even Satan Morocc...#

Go to the building with a mana detector attached to it at the south of this camp and ask about the trace results.#
#

7036#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#

8017#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto has asked you to help him inspect the machines in the factory one at a time to know which one needs to be fixed. Find the 2nd control panel and report back to Zelmeto.#
#

8018#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found the 2nd control panel and it is completely broken. Report this back to Zelmeto.#
#

8019#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto asked you to inspect the automatic pressure governors and to report any problems no matter how small they may seem.#
#

8020#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found the automatic pressure governors and after checking more carefully, you find that it's making strange grinding noises and a few of the surface screws are loose. Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8021#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now Zelmeto asked you to inspect another control panel. It's similar to the first one but bigger. It's located in the middle of the factory. Find it and report back to Zelmeto.#
#

8022#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The main control panel doesn't look like it has any problems. But after tapping on its surface, you hear a disheartening hollow sound. It looks like it's missing some parts... Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8023#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto asked you to inspect a mechanical hand that transports small objects. Find it and report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8024#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The conveyor's movements look jittery and clumsy. The mechanical arm also doesn't look powerful enough to bear the loads that it's carrying... Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8025#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now you must inspect a pipe located near the large cauldrons of molten metal and report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8026#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The pipe you found is bloated and worn out from long durations of being overloaded with pressure. It's a wonder it hasn't exploded yet. Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8027#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The final thing Zelmeto has asked you to inspect is a bigger and more powerful conveyor. Find it and report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8028#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
This last conveyor seems to have similar problems to its smaller version. Its movements are awkward, erratic and weak, and almost all of its screws are rusted. Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8029#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto tells you that he needs to request an increase in the Factory Repair budget from the superintendant to make sure they have enough materials for the repairs. Find the superintendant.#
#

8030#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The superintendant refused to approve the increase in the Factory Repair budget. You'd better report the bad news to Zelmeto.#
#

8031#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto still wants to make the repairs so he has asked you to bring back ^FF000020 Flexible Tube^000000, ^FF000010 Rusty Screw^000000, and ^FF000010 Used Iron Plate^000000 so they can make the needed repairs.#

8036#Hallen's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Hallen has asked you to deliver a letter to Kaci from someone named Mr. Mawong who is something like her mentor.#
Deliver the letter to Kaci.#

8037#The Dice Roller#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You have delivered Hallen's letter to Kaci. You should probably find out what she knows...#
#

8038#The Dice Roller#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
It turns out that Kaci is Hallen's cousin. After answering your questions she has gone back to running her games. Who else would know of their past?#
#

8039#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Hallen tells you that his project is to learn more about how the Airships work. It could benefit you to ask someone who would be knowledgeable about Airships for yourself and report your findings to Hallen.#
#

8040#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Really...? Are you serious? An imitation of Ymir's Heart Piece. Now where have I heard about that before? Mm, let me think... #
Continue talking to Hallen.#

8041#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Kaci told me about a drunkard that always mentions Ymir's Heart when he plays the Dice game for Apples!#
 #

8042#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You find out that the director at the Einbroch Laboratory has a piece of Ymir's Heart. It's worth investigating...#
 #

8043#Secret of Airships#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You better get out of here. The guards patrol this place regularly, so you're almost sure to get caught. Hmm, come and see me later at the Airship, alright? Now hurry!#
You must go and see Ferlock.#

8044#Euslan's Fiancee#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
...Are you really willing to go out and look for Thierry for me? Oh, thank you so much! You don't know how much your kind offer means to me. Thierry went on a trip, traveling on one of the Airships, to find some medicine that the doctors say I need for my illness.#
 #

8045#Tips from Kaci#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Ah, I know! I'll ask the Airship Captain to help you: he's got the list of passengers and their destinations.#
Check out the passengers list from the captain.#

8046#Ferlock's Passengers list#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
According to this, he last took an Airship to Hugel. That's all that this says.#
 #

8047#Euslan's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
If you get the chance, please visit my brother Eukran in Hugel, and ask him where my Thierry might be.#
 #

8048#Eukran's Testimony#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You see, Thierry passed by here about a month ago, and told me that he had to visit the Odin Shrine. I wasn't sure then, but now I think he's trying to help my sister.#
 #

8049#Thierry's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I can't really go into the details, but I'm doing this work to find a cure for Euslan's disease. It's not curable by modern medicine...#
 #

8050#Danger coming on to Thierry#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Thierry seems to have caught on to what we're really up to. I think that's why he's slowing down on his research. We better get rid of him before it's too late.#
 #

8051#Euslan's Medicine#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
It doesn't matter what happens to me, but I must save Euslan. I only need 5 Runes of the Darkness to finish that medicine. Please help me get them, adventurer...#
Gather 5 Runes of the Darkness#

8052#Thierry's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Please understand that I want to see her as soon as I can, but I have to wait until those Rekenber agents stop searching for me. Please give that medicine to Euslan as soon as you can: her life depends on it.#
Deliver the medicine to Euslan.#

8053#Find Postell#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Find Allen's son Postell and to tell him to bring his medicine! Head east, go outside of town, and you should be able to find Postell.#
Postell#

8054#Message from Postell#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Postell has asked you to do him a favor and make sure that his dad doesn't get himself into any more trouble.#
Go back to Allen#

8055#Nursing Allen#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Wh-what if I have another ulcer attack before Postell can bring my meds?! I might not survive! A-adventurer, would you please stay by my side until my son arrives?#
Take care of Allen.#

''This tree means so much to everyone in this town, and we all have special memories of this place. But that El Schatt fellow plans to chop it down for his shop...'' -Manainne#
#

8059#Conversation with Perfitz#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
El Schatt says that his father's been wanting to build a shop here for a long time. Talk to his father Perfitz and get his side of the story.#
#

8060#Stubborn El Schatt#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
''Although I'm pleased, I get this gut feeling that something's not right, like he's too excited about cutting that tree down. Maybe this old man is just too suspicious~'' -Perfitz#
#

8061#Stories of the past#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
El Schatt says that there was a time when he would have protected the tree with his life but that it should be buried in the past. You should find someone that might know about his past.#
#

8062#Kanainne#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
''Now El Schatt is just a heartless, money grubbing...! He's completely changed. My sister would be rolling in her grave, seeing him now...'' -Manainne#

11284#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Looks dirty but 'Rotten Bandages' were soaked in special juice and have special powers. It only takes 2 of these bandages to cover both feet.#
Deliver 2 Rotten Bandages and talk again.#

11285#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Don't know if the door is closed or if it is stuck but since it can't be opened alone, let's do it together!#
Open the door with Las.#

11286#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Pushed the door with all your might but it didn't budge.#
Talk to Las.#

11287#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I'll contact the head office again. Will you ask the villagers about this hospital?#
Talk to the village girl on the right.#

11288#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I don't really know. The hospital has been closed for so long. It's strange for a new nurse to come.#
The village girl doesn't seem to know much. Return to Las.#

11289#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Head office wouldn't send me to a place like this if they weren't sure of themselves. Will you try to talk to another villager?#
Talk to the village man, north from the hospital.#

11290#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I'll have to report this information quickly. Sorry but will you go to the inn in the middle of the village with the nurse?#
Return to Las for now.#

11291#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
My feet hurt and I cannot move anymore. Can you go to the inn alone?#
Meet the doctor at the inn located at the center of the village.#

11292#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I can't go to the hospital right now because I have patients to look after. Can you go back with the key and tell her 'Do as you wish.'.#
Return to Las.#

11293#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Put in the key in the keyhole of the Hospital Door. But the door doesn't seem to be locked.#
Talk to Las.#

11294#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Seems like the voice is coming from the grasses nearby the Hospital Entrance.#
Investigate nearby.#

11295#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Haven't taken a good look thinking I might get caught but I do remember seeing a stick when I went there long ago after my grandmother passed away.#
Investigate hospital surroundings.#

11296#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Pulled out the deeply stuck stick. The hospital's melancholy atmosphere seems to double.#
Better take this agimat to Las.#

11297#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Will you visit my grandma, please? I'll go around to check the hospital here.#
Visit her grandmother at the west of the village.#

11298#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I expected something like this to happen when they cut down the ancient tree in the village to build the hospital.#
Continue to talk to the grandmother.#

11299#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Nurse Las might be in danger all alone in front of the hospital.#
Return to the hospital.#

11300#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Let's go in together since the 1F door is open.#
Talk to Las within the hospital.#

11301#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I've looked around first but I might have missed some details. Will you take a look at the 2F entrance?#
Investigate the 2F entrance.#

11302#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Found an agimat. Let's look for more. Funny to run into a thing like this at a place like this?#
It's nearby.#

11303#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
How did the nurse get through with the entrance bolted up?#
Return to Las.#

11304#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Wouldn't the grandmother who pasted the agimat outside of the hospital know about this agimat?#
Talk to the grandmother.#

11305#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Asked Shaman at the north of the village to create this.#
Visit Shaman at the north of the village.#

11306#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I feel something very ominous from you.#
Received an agimat. Return to Las.#

11307#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Let's paste that agimat onto the agimat we saw at the 2F entrance. It might help block the ominous energy from that one.#
Past the agimat onto the 2F entrance agimat.#

11308#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
As soon as you paste the agimat on top of the other one, the ominous energy feels faded away just like Las said.#
Feel like Las was playing you. Talk to the nurse in front of the hospital.#

11309#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You've not only interrupted my job but you also brought her to the room making you responsible. Don't think of running away.#
Get rid of Bangungot and return.#

A new week has begun, perhaps Derik in Prontera needs help again.#
Conversation with Derik Ver.#

60058#Derik Ver's Brother#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Derik has asked me to take his gathered research to his Brother Jacob in Juno.#
#

60059#A history lesson#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Jacob has assigned me to look up some old histories in the Juno Library to help validate some of his theories.#
#

60060#The Crown of Deceit#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The ancient texts talk of a Crown of Deceit that can work monsters up into a frenzy perhaps that has something to do with all of the monster stirrings of late.  I should let Jacob know about this.#
#

60061#A magic solvent#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Jacob will look for the crown in its last rumored location while I am to hunt some Poporings and Dustiness to get ingredients for a magic solvent to remove the Crown's ancient power.#
Hunt 30 Dustiness and 30 Poporing#

60062#Rendering the crown Inert#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Jacob has found the Crown, and I have the solvent!  I should take both to Payon's mashing mallet to combine the two. Once the Crown has been rendered inert I can go tell my adventure to Derik in Prontera.#

Ask Librarian Jekan if he has found the 1st squad's final mission's paper work. He has bad eyesight and is in need of a Magnifier and a Lantern.#
#

60724#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Librarian Jekan looks to be busy, perhaps I should just 'read some documents' for awhile and then check on the shelves for until he figures out where I should check on the shelves for 'The 3rd Platoon Records'.#
#

60725#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Jekan will need a few items to make a copy of the records. 2 Slick Paper and 1 Oil Paper from Amatsu, 3 Feather of Birds from Morroc, and 20 Blue Gems from Geffen.#
Bring these items to Jekan to make him finish the copy faster.#

60726#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Your copy of the records has a weird search magic on it. To find specific info, you need to first check for broad topic then get more specific: crusader 3rd_company 3rd_platoon 1st_squad.#
Look up the individual members names to find out where they are nowadays.#

60727#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Find Zan Huadoku inside the Geffen Blacksmith guild. Observe politeness when asking him how he is doing before jumping in to ask about their top secret final mission. Yeah, that's the ticket!#
#

60728#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zan Huadoku has told you all that you think is possible. You should head to Morroc to find 'Cuaque Donon' who was last seen at the Inn. You have a feeling that you may need to be stubborn in Morroc.#
#

60729#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Cuaque Donon is in a Rogue Guild hideout probably at 'Fortress Saint Darmain (South)' [use map ctrl + ~] The password to enter should be 'Aragham never hoarded upgrade items'.#
Cuaque is suffering from extreme PTSD and 'freaks out' so pretending he is a young child would help, maybe even a dolly hahaha.#

60730#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Cuaque said the squad found the 'Megingjard' and an argument broke out... You need to know more about that argument, perhaps Jack.O in Alberta on the docks can help.#
He is still an active crusader, so I think talking to him will be much more straight forward.#

60731#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Jack.O found some relief from 'Green Herb's.  Perhaps I should pass that advice onto the other Crusaders I meet.  Emma Searth is in Aldebaran, a quick boat to Izlude and a Kafra warp to Aldebaran will have me there in a jiffy!#
Maybe I should also contemplate a memory aid for these crusaders, something to help them remember their place like a 'Bookclip' from a 'Rideword'#

60732#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I think I need to hurry to see 'The Nineball' he works as a bouncer in the Jawaii inn. I heard there is an ex-barkeep of Jawaii working in the Central Prontera Pub maybe he knows a way to get to Jawaii without tying the knot!#
Someone named Nineball and who is a bouncer probably is pretty closed mouth kinda guy, I should keep talking until he at least reacts to my questions...#

60733#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Exit Jawaii with a Butterflywing or drink yourself back to Rune-Midgarts. Get to Comodo to see 'Royal Myst' at the south casino. Morroc to Comodo is usually the easiest way to warp to Comodo.#
A 'couple' of shots of 'Alcohol' can loosen Royal Myst's tongue...#

60734#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You've spoken to all the crusaders that are still alive, apparently something happened, blame was passed and Crusader Egnigem died in the process. You should return to Prontera Castle and inform him of your findings.#
A kafra hop from Comodo to Morroc to Prontera is quick unless you're saved in Prontera.#

60735#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You should talk to the last member of the 1st squad, the late Egnigem. A Kafra hop from Prontera to Morroc to Comodo then to Umbala and then a journey north to the Tree of Life to Nifflheim can get you to him.#
Listen to Egnigem and see what you can do to fix this.#

60736#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
By Odin's mercy this is terrible, you never believed that a holy Crusader would do such an evil act to claim the power of Megingjard. Be brave and return to the Crusader Headquarters and tell Max Von Shedough what you know.#
#

60737#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Max Von Shedough has accepted my report, and is deeply troubled by its contents, but part of me truly believes that despite good intentions the political reality may intervene to keep justice from being had.#
I must tell Egnigem at least of the outcome, he deserves at least to know what he died for..#

60738#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Egnigem has blessed you with all his remaining strength. You have a feeling that there is one special someone that he would want to know his fate, You must tell Emma Searth about his fate.#
#

60739#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Emma can't Remember, but she can feel the loss. Your faith in Justice is weak now... You must tell Max Von Shedough he is the Judge and he should share this burden of guilt.#
